# Q4. Create variables of all types supported by Python. Then print all of them along with their variable
# name and variable value
#
# Q5. Write Python code to create integer and float variables, at least three of them each. Then print the sum of
# respective integers and float variables on separate lines.

#variable number

first_interger = 40
second_interger = 5
third_interger = 20

print(first_interger + second_interger + third_interger)

#float variables

first_float = 40.5
second_float = 5.5
third_float = 20.0

print(first_float + second_float + third_float)
